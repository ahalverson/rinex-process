I have Rinex files of every day of GPS ephemeris since 1993. Write me a Python script that uses the georinex and pandas library and pulls out all numbers that change randomly, like clock parameters, orbital parameters, etc. Then take those numbers and perform statistical analysis on them such as standard deviation, variance, mean, and any other you think would be important. Additionally, give me information on what the CPU and memory usage of this script could be since this is a considerable amount of data
